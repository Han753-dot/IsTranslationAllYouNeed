     was not worth the price.

  <sentence>
    <aspect-term aspect="FOOD" polarity="negative">Rice</aspect-term>

      <aspect-term aspect="FOOD" polarity="positive">fish</aspect-term>
    </aspect-term>
     to be excellent.
  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    However, the value and 
    <aspect-term aspect="SERVICE" polarity="negative">service</aspect-term>
     are both severely lacking.
    <aspect-term aspect="PRICE" polarity="negative"/>
  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    Furthermore, while the 
    <aspect-term aspect="FOOD" polarity="positive">fish</aspect-term>
     is unquestionably fresh,

     tend to be inexplicably bland.

  <sentence>
    The 
    <aspect-term aspect="SERVICE" polarity="negative">service</aspect-term>

  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    On a recent trip, our

  <sentence>
    Their 
    <aspect-term aspect="FOOD" polarity="positive">apps</aspect-term>

  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    The only drawback is that this 
    <aspect-term aspect="PRICE" polarity="negative">place</aspect-term>
     is really expensive and the 
    <aspect-term aspect="FOOD" polarity="negative">portions</aspect-term>
     are on the small side.
  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    But the 
    <aspect-term aspect="AMBIENCE" polarity="positive">space</aspect-term>

     was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
  </sentence>
  <sentence>
    Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.
